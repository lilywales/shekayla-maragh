            <br/><br/>
            CUBE was formed from a need to support and develop the artistic interests and ambitions of music creatives, particularly those located in the Midlands.
            <br/><br/>
            Being conscious of the talent I get to work with daily is an ever green inspiration, however, over time you identify the challenges and frustrations that come with not having conventional access to core spaces and resources that supports and elevates a music creatives' work and  to make a sustaining career when one lives outside of the music powerhouse that is London.
            <br/><br/>
            CUBE is an enabler and activates opportunties that provide meaningful support in authentic spaces for those same creators, makers and disrupters that I have the privilege to encounter along my own journey.
            <br/><br/>
            More from CUBE soon, stay locked.

        <p>
          I'm Shekayla Maragh, muh - raaj, (you would be surprise at the many laughable pronunciations of folks attempting to say this.. I do love a trier though).
          <br/><br/>
          I am a freelance Creative Producer and Project Manager, working across art-form with a specialism in live music touring, festivals and events. I'm also the founder and director of CUBE, a talent and development agency, designed to serve and support music creatives in the Midlands. A key theme in my practice is to create accessible work for those who are under-represented and misrepresented in arts and culture.
          <br/><br/>
          I have worked nationally and internationally on interdisciplinary cultural projects and produced and delivered for a range of arts organisations and commercial brands such as Punch, Beatfreeks, Birmingham Hippodrome and Selfridges. Some of my projects include Producer for B-Side Hip Hop Festival, Live and Loud festival, Diaspora Britain and have worked on a range of large-scale outdoor events such as Glastonbury, Birmingham Weekender and Birmingham's Commonwealth Games handover. I also sometimes get asked to speak on panels and to guest lecture at universities.
          <br/><br/>
          No one really has time to read large volumes of text these days, I once read that a humans attention span is now less than that of a gold fish. If you're still reading and what to find out more about my work, drop me an email. I'm always open to listening.
